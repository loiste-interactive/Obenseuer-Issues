# Obenseuer-Issues

This is the public issue tracker of Obenseuer. Report any issues you encounter playing the game here.

If you'd like to discuss the game with fellow players, you can join the Obenseuer Discord Server here: https://discord.gg/NSHHqEP

## How to report an issue?

* Check that the issue doesn't exist on the tracker already to avoid duplicates
* Take a screensot of the issue or location where the issue happens.
* Describe the issue as accurately as possible, like where and when does it happen
* Describe how to reproduce the issue
* Does the issue persist, does it happen at random, does it happen after loading a game?
* For non trivial bugs it's good to provide logs found from "C:\Users\ [username] \AppData\LocalLow\Loiste Interactive\Obenseuer"
